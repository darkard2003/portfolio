# Portfolio GOTTH

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and experience as a developer.

## About the Project

- **Blazing fast**: The site is optimized for quick loading and smooth navigation, ensuring a seamless experience for visitors.
- **Responsive design**: Built with TailwindCSS, the layout adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Type-safe templates**: Uses Templ for Go, providing robust, type-safe HTML generation and component composition.
- **Single source of truth**: All content is managed via a single `data.json` file, making updates simple and consistent.
- **Modern stack**: Powered by Go, Templ, TailwindCSS, and Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity.

This portfolio is a reflection of my skills and design philosophy—minimal, efficient, and focused on delivering a great user experience.
